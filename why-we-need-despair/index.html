  </div></div><p>From <strong>The Reverend Report</strong><br><em>Despair is the precursor to greatness!</em></p><p>THE REVEREND OF DESPAIR<br>
COLUMNIST AND VISIONARY</p><p>As the Reverend of Despair, I have been asked many times why I believe humanity can find value in the absence of hope. Our whole lives, we are taught to possess endless hope in all situations. We constantly challenge ourselves to work hard, and try to impress other people with our achievements. Our egos are built up telling us we are all special, possess liberty and will succeed at our dreams if we try hard enough. People also believe it's import to have fun in their lives.</p><p>Most of us living with such philosophies think we are happy and free, or at least have the potential to be. Unfortunately, these &quot;positive&quot; worldviews affect people in a most sinister of ways. They were ingrained in us by authority figures and don't reflect the realities of our situations. The victims of this kind of thinking are bound to become disillusioned sooner or later. Even if they don't have an existential crisis, they will have lived a wasted life. Think of all the struggle and pain involved in the ordinary man's existence. Surely one cannot imagine a more terrifying scenario than having lived a wasted life.</p><p>Fortunately, the universe has provided us with a marvelous tool to turn miserable cowards into real men and women; that tool being <em>despair</em>. We take prescription drugs and drink alcohol to avoid the pain of life. We think we can understand how things work and laugh off ideas that seem radical or uncomfortable. How many of you have taken a real risk in the past week or truly reflected upon the paradigm of thought that limits your very existence? Have you considered your own mortality or why you really crave the objects of your desire?</p><p>My point is, if you aren't conscious of your situation you may think you're happy, but to look at the reality of our situations can only lead to despair. We can't think ourselves out of these problems once we are aware of them, but rational arguments can help expose the ignorance and desperation of the human condition. Don't be ashamed of feeling trapped, lonely and hopeless! Motivational speakers have filled you with the shame that robs you of the ability to reflect upon your very own situation. Maybe your life really is dreadful, and you keep blaming yourself for it without making any real changes.</p><p>Experiencing hopelessness brings us back to reality and having unlocked the gates of our subconscious world, everything begins to fall apart. Your life will be in shambles and every moment will be an epic struggle. If you get to this point consider yourself lucky and think to yourself, &quot;Brilliant! I'm being freed from my old self.&quot; Thank that fellow who dumped you, and the boss who fired you, along with that stupid columnist who had the guts to tell you the truth. We are very fortunate in that this world offers us no shortage of misfortunes. Be grateful for all the tribulations you experience that help to open your eyes.</p><p>Going through real change for the better can never be easy. It is in the emptiness of a total vacuum that matter springs into existence according to the discoveries of quantum mechanics. It is within the depths of eternal chaos that we can find true freedom. Rationality will not lead you out of the void, only your intuition can. It is the children of the void that I respect; those who have embraced the chaos and realized that we are all riding a quite temporary wave. They are the ones who have transcended our agreed upon reality. They are no longer slaves of their fortune. When you take responsibility for your existence, then you can live without fear. Rebirth can only come about through the annihilation of the soul.</p><p>Looking to the other extreme, some of you may be smart and say, &quot;Reverend, why don't we just all kill ourselves if everything is looking so gloomy?&quot; To you I say don't be so hopeful that death will improve your situation. If we can't fix our problems while we walk this earth, what makes us think we can escape our fears through a physical departure? Suicide may seem to be a rational choice at times, but many of the world's most hideous atrocities have been committed in the name of rational thought, so don't be so quick to adopt views that have no heart. Do you not see how replacing ethics with cold Scientism has misled you? It has robbed you of your humanity. If we believe so firmly in the principal of the conservation of energy, why do we reject the possibly that there is also a conservation of consciousness at work in this world?</p><p>People who walk around in constant terror for their lives or who continuously mourn for the troubles of others can use the lessons of despair more than the rest of us! They are deceiving themselves for they cling desperately to their hope, and acquire a masochistic pleasure from their fear. For those of you who are still living in a rosy world free of troubles and are unconvinced that you should bother with the messy and unpredictable art of self-improvement, you have been warned. Existing in a state of ignorance is both inauthentic and risky. There is nothing wrong with living any way you chose, but you are not living in a world that favors static character. Those who possess the abilities of adaptation will surely thrive.</p><p>I will not believe for a second that the meek shall inherit the earth. You may be humble outwardly, but must also dare to explore inner space, to become humbled within. Socrates said, &quot;Know thyself,&quot; and those possessing the courage to take him up on his challenge shall rise above the rest. Know that the only way to discover this knowledge is through despair. Repent not for your sins, but for your ignorance.</p><p>&quot;Pain is the precursor to change.&quot;<br>
