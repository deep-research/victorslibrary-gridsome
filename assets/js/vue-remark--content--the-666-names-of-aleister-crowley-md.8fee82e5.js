six hundred and sixty six names of Aleister Crowley\nThis isn’t fun, this is evil\n\nHe who is like the axe to cut the enjoyable life from the world\nHe who is the personification of all that is evil\nHe who instills fear\nHe who removes pleasures\nHe who takes away all forms of wealth and happiness\nHe who is hate personified\nHe who is devoid of love\nHe who is permanently unstable\nHe who is attained by confused people\nHe who is warfare\nHe who is forever defiled\nHe who has many desires\nHe who has many firm beliefs\nHe who is worried\nHe who has many passions\nHe who has selfish feelings\nHe who has committed many sins\nHe who fills us with anger\nHe who is misery\nHe who fills us with doubt\nHe who promotes separation\nHe who fills us with the fear of life\nHe who has dark black eyes\nHe who keeps far away from peaceful men\nHe who takes away pleasure and happiness\nHe who destroys peaceful practices\nHe who is full of regret\nHe who gifts us the evil path\nHe who is a result of mental illness\nHe who is worshiped by horrible people\nHe who gives great pain\nHe who enjoys illegal pleasures\nHe who has no wealth\nHe who is very weak\nHe who should be worshiped by performing Satanic sacrifices\nHe who should be worshiped with 666 offerings\nHe who is very ugly\nHe who has a horrid scowl\nHe who is the son of fire\nHe who sits upon a throne of endless dead bodies\nHe who is supremely wrathful\nHe who is always in a state of pain\nHe who is in a delirious trance\nHe who is the personification of Hell\nHe who destroys\nHe who gives reward for sin\nHe who is the Father of Darkness\nHe who denies pleasures\nHe who is incomplete\nHe who has no heart\nHe who does not have aspects that can be accepted\nHe who cannot make others happy\nHe who rapes he devotees\nHe who has the face of pain\nHe who does not protect\nHe who is masculine\nHe who is very interested in children\nHe who is the form of pain\nHe who does evil\nHe who is like a cancer in the world\nHe who has hateful eyes\nHe who is the son of the juice of revenge\nHe who is the unapproachable father\nHe who is the unification of disease and hate\nHe who is eternal suffering\nHe who lives in the Dark Abbey of Thelema\nHe whose orders can never be disobeyed\nHe who forces people to worship him\nHe who is the lamp that draws in children\nHe who shows violence without reason\nHe who can be realized by constant disappointment\nHe who gives what is not desired\nHe who has a terrible history\nHe who is a magnet to sin\nHe who has attained all sides of the reverse pentagram\nHe who is our father\nHe who is the lord of the three zones of fire, darkness, and molestation\nHe who shows the symbol of torture\nHe who can be attained by apathy\nHe who shows the symbol of ignorance\nHe who is worshiped by 93 symbols of the hand\nHe who preceded every one\nHe who is not happy with the offering of love\nHe who has an unclean mind\nHe who does not shine\nHe who likes the worship of widowed women\nHe who embodies the fragrance of alcohol\nHe who takes away all hopeful things\nHe who likes to watch children play\nHe who is an old pervert\nHe who has the joy of a miscarried fetus\nHe who knows no peace\nHe who is not beyond anything\nHe who is not beyond properties\nHe who is confined to worldly pleasure\nHe who depletes dharma\nHe who hates dharma\nHe who gives no forms of wealth\nHe who is impermanent\nHe who is to be worshiped by the five methods of blood, semen, fecal matter, urine, and 2C-B-FLY-7\nHe who is the Great Beast\nHe whose number of 666\nHe who sleeps on a cot made of dead children\nHe who enjoys many sacrifices\nHe who is the god of people on the wrong path\nHe who lives at the bottom\nHe who is not one with mind\nHe who has great sadness\nHe who is a great thief\nHe who is cowardly\nHe who will never repent\nHe who does not support the world\nHe who is the Father of Nothingness\nHe who does only evil\nHe who is the most horrible god\nHe who has a stone heart\nHe who has an unstable mind\nHe who is worshiped by those under the influence of drugs\nHe who hates art\nHe who makes many mistakes\nHe who takes away heavenly stature\nHe who is a mixture of manipulation and dominance by fear\nHe who is high on superiority\nHe who is never happy\nHe who hates the life and light of the flowers\nHe who is worshiped by the ablation of toxic liquid\nHe who is weak and vile\nHe who is, by nature, bitter\nHe who has nothing within him\nHe who fills the world with danger\nHe who likes the sacrilegious and esoteric methods\nHe who is the consort of G.G.
