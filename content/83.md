description: |
  This song was recorded back in the era when Victor was interested in the art of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_growl" target="_blank">death growl</a>.
  
  Black metal bands such as Darkthrone were a major inspiration.

lyrics: |
    War

    Why did they send you here?
    To fight these so called enemies?
    I will suffer drenched in blood
    Is this worth the glory for me?

    There is no point to war
    Dodging bullets annihilate
    We’re told they must be destroyed
    I still don’t know what for
