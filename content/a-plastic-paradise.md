lyrics: |
  All these years of these fears are falling away
  I can’t say that one day if that I’ll be dismayed
  I’ll follow you, I’ll see it through
  By the pain of our nation’s youth

  Don’t hide, don’t cry, don’t compromise
  ’cause you know that we’ll find you anyway
  We’ll liberate, profits made, it’s far too late
  For canceling the game

  We’ll think of reasons it’s alright
  Question their faith and patriotism
  Scaremongering public into fear
  Pay taxes or the end is near, end is near

  Educate, asphyxiate your brain
  Filled with trash, stripped of all good you won’t last
  Sticking you in a cube, watch the tube
  Now you’re never in the mood

  To fight for the plight of our rights
  It’s okay, for today, the Newocrats just may
  Help the cause, stop the blood, end the plight
  Of this world all alight

  All of you get what you deserve
  For complaining doing nothing
  This ain’t the first time that this happened
  It’s like Rome or Hitler without weed, without weed

  Freedom of speech means shouting fire, in a crowded theater,
  Screw all those damn satanic kids, with their, dirty rock and roll

  Yeah
  Alright

  Stand up and fight today, before your rights are taken away

  Oh
  Yeah
  Ra

  Let’s end this empire’s reign and buy some freedom in pain

  Ah
  Kaka kapata, kakakaka
  Ah
