description: |
  This very intense song inspired by our friends in the police state.

lyrics: |
  I hate you all
  You f*\*\*ing cowards
  Why don’t you go
  Do something worthwhile
  
  You fight a plant
  And ruin me
  While all the rapists
  They will run free

  Nation of hate
  Land of tyranny
  All the f*\*\*ing pigs
  Control everything

  Free your mind
  While you’re in chains
  I wish the leaders
  Would get some brains

  They call it justice
  It’s genocide
  They want to help you
  To help you die

  Union of pain
  State of hypocrisy
  Lies control the people
  Freedom’s a joke to me

  Emperor will terrorize
  Empathy he’ll sacrifice
  Conspirators, he will approve
  Obstacles, he will remove

  You don’t know truth and I can tell you anymore
  You must go out into the world on your own
  Go explore the mysteries, old cosmic philosophies
  And then return, where you were born

  They call you crazy and they say that you’re insane,
  But for what you’ve become there is no man to blame
  You’ve seen too much to live the life an average would
  One day they’ll understand when they witness what you could

  Attempting to survive
  In alternative planes of existence
  Find out where you belong
  Together we will journey on
