lyrics: |
  Life alone an endless circle, going on and on
  What do I have, to be looking forward to?
  Nothing’s good without a struggle, anymore
  Why can’t I force myself, to do the things I need to do?

  No one cares for any other, in honesty
  Who do we think we are? Promising so much won’t matter
  Your ideology will drown me, in my own fear
  Can’t you reason with me? Save me now the end is near

  Save me
