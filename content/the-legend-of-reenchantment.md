Around the year two thousand and six, a troubled artist known as Comrade Victor discovered a collection of sacred texts. The artifacts were found in a chamber on the very fringes of our reality. These priceless documents contained an extraordinary glimpse into the mysteries of rock music.

Comrade Victor suffers from a rare form of psychosis.

Comrade Victor immediately began assembling a team of experts to help him disseminate this revolutionary information to the wider world. A secret bunker was chosen as the primary base of operations, and couple of nearby encampments were also used for ceremonial purposes. Some extraordinary results were obtained.

The Former Shroud of Delirium

After the initial experiments were concluded, Comrade Victor ventured forth and was able to take control of a local [radio station](https://wmxm.org/). Comrade Aaron took a far more radical approach by fleeing into the wilderness and joining a [commune](https://www.lamafoundation.org/).

It was in the year two thousand and eighteen that Comrade Victor created this website as a propaganda distribution system. He are currently on the front lines of a crusade to reenchant the world. As Nietzsche wrote:

> "The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself."  
> – Friedrich Nietzsche

There is a transcendent power that shines through his art, and he is dedicated to bringing it down to earth.
