Abstract: There is a duality in life between the rational mind and the emotional mind. This paper proposes a model for mediating between the two that would be helpful in explaining the philosophical meaning of music and for deriving a values system thereof. It also explores the spiritual dimensions of music that offer even more evidence for the accuracy of this model.
