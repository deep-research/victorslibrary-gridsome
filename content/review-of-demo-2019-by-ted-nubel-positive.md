### Chicago Doom Confederacy Review

Strange People In Pain is the latest project from a rather mysterious figure formerly known as "The Lord Reverend Wizard of Alchemical Despair", or more colloquially, Victor Fisher. I first met Victor when he joined Sacred Monster as a vocalist for a few months, way before we even recorded our first EP. That didn't work out due to time constraints, but in the short while that he was in the band, it was apparent that Victor was in a league of his own, musically and otherwise -- he operates on a different plane of existence than most of us mortals. That's especially apparent with his latest project, "Strange People In Pain", which he's kicked off recently with a two-song demo that showcases the different aspects of the sound and its basis in philosophical musings.

The opener, "They'll Come For You (Mermaid Version)", is a relaxed atmospheric rock track, though the chord progressions feel rooted in 70's rock (Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac particularly) to me, with obvious psychedelic influences. Victor and his co-conspirator Aaron Schreiber have created an extremely comforting vibe here even with some demo aspects in the sound -- programmed drums, some digital-feeling tones at points -- that's relaxing to listen to. That's kind of a juxtaposition with the depressing lyrical content, which lambasts the tendencies of modern society to restrict free will and education.

On the flip side is "The Ritual", with a doomier sound closer to T.L.R.W.o.A.D.'s previous output. It feels almost like a black metal lens cast upon the atmospheric rock of the opening track, which averages out to a slow, evil and groovy affair with harsher vocals. Still present here are the 70s-feeling progressions and adept manipulation of melodies to craft something that's far more than just a few riffs stapled together. So, think first-wave black metal riffs tied together with Black Sabbath trimmings and you're getting there.

Victor is not one for convention, which is why to listen to this demo in the intended order you'll need to hit up the [band website](https://victorslibrary.com/), where you can also check out the backstory on the band, which has been written in a sort of tongue-in-cheek historical retrospective tone.

I end up running into Victor every couple of years -- sometimes physically, sometimes through email, and it's always nice to see what he's up to. Fun fact -- a while back he filled in on bass with Sacred Monster at a Mutiny show for a single cover of Black Sabbath's "Snowblind", which also makes him, technically, a live member. I can't really predict what he'll be up to next, but make sure you listen to this latest iteration.
