lyrics: |
  We traveled to the temple
  To bow down to the cloud
  I shudder to remember
  The secrets that we found

  Paralyzed with terror
  I crawled into the room
  The priest of intuition
  Was creeping in the gloom

  Countless lives were shattered
  We awakened from the tomb
  The shadows will remember
  The children of the broom

  We conjured unknown forces
  With the spells of the sacred shroom
  The seekers of the spirit realm
  Will reclaim the prize of doom
