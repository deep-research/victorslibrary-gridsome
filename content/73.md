description: |
  This atmospheric doom metal song is the earliest one I wrote for my high school band, Shroud of Delirium. The recording is also one of the first ones I made that I still have access to.

  In addition to doom metal, I was heavily influenced by black metal during this period.

lyrics: |
  Wandering on the paths of mist
  I reflect upon my wasted life
  Pondering the mistakes that I made
  Jealous of what could have been

  Each step is closer to my destiny
  The path that is written for us

  I cannot control the future
  For man is nothing
