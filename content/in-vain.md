  RT Reporter:
  > Mike Gravel is the senator who exposed widespread atrocities by the US in the Vietnam War.
  > Senator, has the US committed crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and why is no US politician today exposing that?

  Senator Mike Gravel:
  > I am extremely concerned, I am extremely horrified, and I am extremely embarrassed.
  > I think my country is an imperial country.
  > We spend more on defense than all of the rest of the world put together, and we’re broke.
  > One-third of our children don’t even graduate from high-school.
  > All these American soldiers have died in vain, died in vain.
  > And this is a comment that I got from a general.
  > He said, “Mike, they died in vain.”

  I am dead to you
  Got buried in the tomb,
  Of your emotion baby
  Can’t let the feeling be
  Why did it have to happen?
  I lost myself to you
  Can’t go on like this anymore

  Senator Mike Gravel:
  > They died in vain, in vain.

  There is no hope for us to leave this f\*\*\*ing trap
  They sold us out to have the wealth of our nation
  You buy into their b\*\*\*s\*\*\* plans, you won’t have a chance
  Think for yourself, and you’ll be free, m\*\*\*erf\*\*\*er yeah

  Senator Mike Gravel:
  > As a result of 9/11, we have altered our moral compass.
  > We Americans used to think, oh, what happened in Germany could never happen with us. Well, it’s happening with us.
  > A government official, whether it’s military or not, puts your name on a list, because he thinks you’re a traitor or you’re a terrorist.
  > Puts your name on a list, then we dispatch a drone to follow you and then we eventually take it upon ourselves to kill you, without any trial, without any evidence, and then kill about ten other civilians that happen to be standing next to you.
  > It’s difficult for people to understand that when you drop bombs from the air on people, you don’t see ’em die. You don’t see ’em die. They’re down there. You don’t see ’em. You don’t see ’em die.
  > Here, our actions, our actions are causing people to die. Causing people to die. Our actions are causing people to die.
  
  Take it to the streets now
  Go get your f\*\*\*in’ piece now
  Get ready, to take back your rights
  Take it to the streets now
  Get out your f\*\*\*in’ piece now
  Get ready to take back, your God-given rights come on
  Clean their clock
  Yeah yeah
  You know their m\*\*\*erf\*\*\*ing clock
