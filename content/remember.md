lyrics: |
  Stumbling through the voids of rejection
  Crumbling without any intention
  Suffer the weight of the world, it’s your fate
  You wanted to journey forever
  When it was too late

  It was too late, for you

  Blinded by your rage, you’re down all the time
  Being true to yourself, is considered a crime
  Nobody’s feeling for you, you never knew what to do
  You were locked in the chains of your gloom

  You’re blind to the world before your own eyes
  Imagining, no one needs you
  But life always keeps going on
  Eternally, from the dusk to the dawn

  Remember how you were before, they wanted to change you
  Remember how you sang with tears in your eyes, before you learned all their lies
  Remember what you showed yourself, how you carried on, the dreams you saw
  Remember your own self from before this prison, you were fighting for

  I can see that we’re following, a path that is leading to harmony
  And the truth of coming together, forms in the mind forever
  I can plead for unknown happening, and still be content with my experience
  Others live their lives blinded by fear, it’ll take away all you hold dear

  Visions of a final destination,
  A place where one can rest in perfect elation
  The memories of the past, those treasured thoughts mind has cast,
  Long from its gaze, abandon the maze

  But you die, slowly before your own eyes
  Still imagining no one needs you
  But life doesn’t always go on
  Perishing, from the birth to the lost

  Remember how you were before they wanted to, chain you
  Remember how you sang with tears in your eyes, before you learned all their lies
  Remember what you showed yourself, how you carried on, the dreams you lost
  Remember your own self from before this prison, you were living for

  I’ll remember you
  I’ll be missing you
