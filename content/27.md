band: Reenchantment
authors: ["Victor Fisher"]
explicit: false

description: |
  This is a highly romanticized doom metal song. They should play this at the opera.

lyrics: |
  A storm approaches, the clouds are darkened, black castles reign the sky
  The hour is nearing, all we were fearing, donâ€™t be afraid to die
  Nothing familiar, is here for comfort, night and shade collide
  Cold thorns are bleeding, me from the inside, how did I lose my life

  Where have we gone now, so far away from, all that I ever tried
  To hold together, our bond forever

  Yeah

  And I beg the heavens for solace
  I cry and weep and pray, heal me

  What have I done to deserve this fate
