lyrics: |
  Die forever more, when you can’t live with yourself
  Slowly drowning deep, without your own consciousness
  How you see yourself, can determine your fate
  You’ve got to save yourself, before the time is too late

  In our society, we all believe
  We can read others, as we perceive
  You better figure out, your own way
  Before you bring about, other’s pain

  Never trusting in, the people you once called friend
  Feel so left behind, in times when everything ends
  What is there to believe, when there is nothing to prove
  With anything you try, after struggle you lose

  Journey, to the beyond
  Wavelength, all slowed down
  Fall awake, take it in all around
  Expanding to, universal sight and sound

  Traverse onto the waves of inspiration
  Find unity beyond all separation
  When you travel, on an astral journey
  To yourself

  Traverse onto the waves of inspiration
  Find unity beyond all segregation
  When you travel, on an astral journey
  To yourself

  Leave everything behind, before you can be reborn
  Just disconnect yourself, from what you thought was the norm
  One day you’ll understand, what the seeker can reach
  Holy epiphany, ecstatic truth within reach

  In our society, we all believe
  We must destroy those, who don’t concede
  You better save yourself, and your own mind
  Before they limit you, the way they’re blind
