lyrics: |
  Charles Manson:
  > You don’t understand me, that’s your trouble 
  > It’s not my fault because you don’t understand me 
  > I don’t understand you either, but I don’t spend my whole life trying to put the blame over on you because my cigarette didn’t light, or because something didn’t work right 
  >
  > What do you wanna call me a murderer for?
  > I’ve never killed anyone 
  > I don’t need to kill anyone 
  >
  > I think it  
  > I have it here 
  >
  > I don’t need to live in this physical realm 
  > I walk around in the physical realm
  > And I put on the faces and I talk and I play...
  > It's just a big act man
  >
  > In the spiritual world is where I live  
  > I exist in places you’ve never even dreamed of
