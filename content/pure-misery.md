lyrics: |
  Where have I gone in my life?
  That is worth mentioning?
  Who will remember me when I’m when I’m gone?
  What is the point of anything?

  Sometime I wonder at the world
  Aren’t all things relative?
  Is there still something that is good?
  Or has god abandoned everything?

  Each day people live their lives
  Repeating on without end
  But I have woken up from this dream, these dreams
  And in my life I’m still alone

  So now you’ve all left me for good
  All the lies they vanish in the air
  But I don’t know if I could
  Go on as I have anymore

  I’m losing reality
  My mind’s stuck in ethereal fantasies
  And no one can help me
  Everything around me is pure misery
