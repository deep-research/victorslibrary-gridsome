title: "Song: The Truth About This World"
band: Reenchantment
authors: ["Victor Fisher"]
explicit: false

description: 
  This contains philosophical musings about the mysteries of the universe.

lyrics: |
  Did the wise men know the truth about this world?
  About this world of ours
  That I find myself within
  About this world of ours
  That I am bound to dwell within

  Is there a place for those who wish to know?
  For those of us who feel the dream
  Or does it lie beyond the grave?
