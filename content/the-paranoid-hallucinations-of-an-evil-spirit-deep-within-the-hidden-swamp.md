lyrics: |
  You carry on
  Living fine
  Nothing to wonder
  Complacent mind

  You are so focused
  An assembly line
  So relieved so happy
  Your time to shine

  A void is building
  Within your being
  Your pseudo world
  Delusion’s dream

  While you are guided
  By other’s ways
  You’re being supplanted
  In cosmic haze
