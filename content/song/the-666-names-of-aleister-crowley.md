  The six hundred and sixty six names of Aleister Crowley
  This isnâ€™t fun, this is evil

  He who is like the axe to cut the enjoyable life from the world
  He who is the personification of all that is evil
  He who instills fear
  He who removes pleasures
  He who takes away all forms of wealth and happiness
  He who is hate personified
  He who is devoid of love
  He who is permanently unstable
  He who is attained by confused people
  He who is warfare
  He who is forever defiled
  He who has many desires
  He who has many firm beliefs
  He who is worried
  He who has many passions
  He who has selfish feelings
  He who has committed many sins
  He who fills us with anger
  He who is misery
  He who fills us with doubt
  He who promotes separation
  He who fills us with the fear of life
  He who has dark black eyes
  He who keeps far away from peaceful men
  He who takes away pleasure and happiness
  He who destroys peaceful practices
  He who is full of regret
  He who gifts us the evil path
  He who is a result of mental illness
  He who is worshiped by horrible people
  He who gives great pain
  He who enjoys illegal pleasures
  He who has no wealth
  He who is very weak
  He who should be worshiped by performing Satanic sacrifices
  He who should be worshiped with 666 offerings
  He who is very ugly
  He who has a horrid scowl
  He who is the son of fire
  He who sits upon a throne of endless dead bodies
  He who is supremely wrathful
  He who is always in a state of pain
  He who is in a delirious trance
  He who is the personification of Hell
  He who destroys
  He who gives reward for sin
  He who is the Father of Darkness
  He who denies pleasures
  He who is incomplete
  He who has no heart
  He who does not have aspects that can be accepted
  He who cannot make others happy
  He who rapes he devotees
  He who has the face of pain
  He who does not protect
  He who is masculine
  He who is very interested in children
  He who is the form of pain
  He who does evil
  He who is like a cancer in the world
  He who has hateful eyes
  He who is the son of the juice of revenge
  He who is the unapproachable father
  He who is the unification of disease and hate
  He who is eternal suffering
  He who lives in the Dark Abbey of Thelema
  He whose orders can never be disobeyed
  He who forces people to worship him
  He who is the lamp that draws in children
  He who shows violence without reason
  He who can be realized by constant disappointment
  He who gives what is not desired
  He who has a terrible history
  He who is a magnet to sin
  He who has attained all sides of the reverse pentagram
  He who is our father
  He who is the lord of the three zones of fire, darkness, and molestation
  He who shows the symbol of torture
  He who can be attained by apathy
  He who shows the symbol of ignorance
  He who is worshiped by 93 symbols of the hand
  He who preceded every one
  He who is not happy with the offering of love
  He who has an unclean mind
  He who does not shine
  He who likes the worship of widowed women
  He who embodies the fragrance of alcohol
  He who takes away all hopeful things
  He who likes to watch children play
  He who is an old pervert
  He who has the joy of a miscarried fetus
  He who knows no peace
  He who is not beyond anything
  He who is not beyond properties
  He who is confined to worldly pleasure
  He who depletes dharma
  He who hates dharma
  He who gives no forms of wealth
  He who is impermanent
  He who is to be worshiped by the five methods of blood, semen, fecal matter, urine, and 2C-B-FLY-7
  He who is the Great Beast
  He whose number of 666
  He who sleeps on a cot made of dead children
  He who enjoys many sacrifices
  He who is the god of people on the wrong path
  He who lives at the bottom
  He who is not one with mind
  He who has great sadness
  He who is a great thief
  He who is cowardly
  He who will never repent
  He who does not support the world
  He who is the Father of Nothingness
  He who does only evil
  He who is the most horrible god
  He who has a stone heart
  He who has an unstable mind
  He who is worshiped by those under the influence of drugs
  He who hates art
  He who makes many mistakes
  He who takes away heavenly stature
  He who is a mixture of manipulation and dominance by fear
  He who is high on superiority
  He who is never happy
  He who hates the life and light of the flowers
  He who is worshiped by the ablation of toxic liquid
  He who is weak and vile
  He who is, by nature, bitter
  He who has nothing within him
  He who fills the world with danger
  He who likes the sacrilegious and esoteric methods
  He who is the consort of G.G. Allen
