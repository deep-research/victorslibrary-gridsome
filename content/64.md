  Listen to this song in a misty graveyard, late at night. It will allow you to master the dark arts.

lyrics: |
  The curse of the gothic rainberries at death’s door

  Passageway, into the hidden the land
  A secret monument, to mystic shadow chant
  We cannot understand, the mark of misery
  An omen from the sky, warning now all faith shall die

  I didn’t want to, give up, my faith in this world

  You made me do this, this isn’t me
  I feel dissociated, I’ve lost my personality
  There is no time for comfort
  No one will pardon all my sins
  This is an ugly universe
  No place, for a man like me

  I can’t stay here
  Say your goodbyes
  This is the end for me

  If you must do it, just do it now

  Worship the coming end of time
  Picture apocalyptic ways
  Let go of all you have confined
  All will be lost in final haze

  Save me now
  It is the end we fear
  An entire world crippled
  Our final days are here
