  This song is inspired by the wicked powers of datura!

lyrics: |
  Uncharted Wasteland
  Beyond our safe abode
  Recall the dark clan
  Inspiring fear unknown

  Pass wretched landscapes
  You ignore the ancient drone
  Eat poison mandrakes
  Unleashing terror grown

  Cult ritual rises as the sacrament will show
  Your soul abides within the limits that you know
  Freedom we try to find in new extremes revealed
  That sickness overcomes till you are truly healed

  Night again, falls over you
  All things familiar shrouded by the gloom
  Majesty in hidden form revealed
  Within the darkness binding fate is sealed

  Keep estimating where the meaning lies
  Interpretating is your own demise
  Youâ€™re being hated as you try to rise
  Above the simple being we all prize

  I want to be free
  From this insanity
  I need to be fine
  With this fate of mine
