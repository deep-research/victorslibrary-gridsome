lyrics: |
  The autumn heaven was still fresh in my mind, it was a pain that I could feel
  Note how surroundings mirror your inner world, and how you think you’ll never heal
  Thought that she was perfect, got to tell myself that I can fight
  You know that wallowing with drugs and booze won’t make things right, for you

  When you were younger, they were telling you that you’ll be free
  But looking at the suffering your friends are going through you’ll see, that
  This life is built in such a way that we can just hold on
  Think of checkin’ out a little early it’s considered wrong

  I want to tell you all
  The apathetic are free
  They’ve got some liberty
  The apathetic are free
  A lot freer than

  I promise you that those in comfort will get swept away
  When they least expect it things will crumble giving them our pain
  It’s far superior to kill your brain, don’t feel at all
  Why live in fear of all the troubles that have done you wrong?

  As for myself I’m thinkin’ lately I’ve been doing fine
  Things have been improving though the scars are on this heart of mine
  I’d never blame a girl for telling me she had to go
  Thank god these feelings I’ve been going through she’ll never know

  I want to tell you all
  The apathetic are free
  They got that liberty
  The apathetic are free
  A lot freer than me
  A lot freer than
