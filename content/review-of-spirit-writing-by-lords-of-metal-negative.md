What the flying f**k have I got here? Weird samples of spoken words that seem to be delivered by a rapper, electronic beats. What the hell does this have to do with doom? Yes, I know, a band name doesnt say a thing, but mister Reverend Of Despair himself describes his music as doom. I know that that isnt the be all and end all either (case in point Alexi Laiho who once said that Children Of Bodom played black metal) but the entire package screamed doom metal at me.

After three totally alienating songs of which song number three asks How Enlightened Are You? (well, totally not at all it seems), we get The Grieg And Euphorization Revealed and lo and behold here is the doom that was promised, even though the heavily distorted vocals still make it as alienating as can be. And what the hell is A Plastic Paradise? Rap/funk doom? And it just keeps on going on like this on the entire album. Really, almost everything is fired at the listener even though it is clear that all the time its the same band/man/project. A song such as The Curse Of The Gothic Rainberries At Deaths Door (the song title alone is enough to make me scream) is doom once again. After having listened to this album about twenty times I am still not sure, this is pure genius or the biggest junk ever. It has been very long ago, if at all, that an album has left me behind this confused. Congratulations, mister Reverend Of Despair for achieving something extremely rare. That fact in itself deserves my fullest respect. Oh yeah, the last four songs are by Reverend Of Despairs full band Shroud Of Delirium but fit snugly with the rest of the songs featured here. Grading this work is an impossible task. My advice to everyone is, check this out for yourselves and lets see if you get just as confused as me.
