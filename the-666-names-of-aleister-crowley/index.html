]</div><h2>Lyrics</h2><div>The six hundred and sixty six names of Aleister Crowley
This isn’t fun, this is evil

He who is like the axe to cut the enjoyable life from the world
He who is the personification of all that is evil
He who instills fear
He who removes pleasures
He who takes away all forms of wealth and happiness
He who is hate personified
He who is devoid of love
He who is permanently unstable
He who is attained by confused people
He who is warfare
He who is forever defiled
He who has many desires
He who has many firm beliefs
He who is worried
He who has many passions
He who has selfish feelings
He who has committed many sins
He who fills us with anger
He who is misery
He who fills us with doubt
He who promotes separation
He who fills us with the fear of life
He who has dark black eyes
He who keeps far away from peaceful men
He who takes away pleasure and happiness
He who destroys peaceful practices
He who is full of regret
He who gifts us the evil path
He who is a result of mental illness
He who is worshiped by horrible people
He who gives great pain
He who enjoys illegal pleasures
He who has no wealth
He who is very weak
He who should be worshiped by performing Satanic sacrifices
He who should be worshiped with 666 offerings
He who is very ugly
He who has a horrid scowl
He who is the son of fire
He who sits upon a throne of endless dead bodies
He who is supremely wrathful
He who is always in a state of pain
He who is in a delirious trance
He who is the personification of Hell
He who destroys
He who gives reward for sin
He who is the Father of Darkness
He who denies pleasures
He who is incomplete
He who has no heart
He who does not have aspects that can be accepted
He who cannot make others happy
He who rapes he devotees
He who has the face of pain
He who does not protect
He who is masculine
He who is very interested in children
He who is the form of pain
He who does evil
He who is like a cancer in the world
He who has hateful eyes
He who is the son of the juice of revenge
He who is the unapproachable father
He who is the unification of disease and hate
He who is eternal suffering
He who lives in the Dark Abbey of Thelema
He whose orders can never be disobeyed
He who forces people to worship him
He who is the lamp that draws in children
He who shows violence without reason
He who can be realized by constant disappointment
He who gives what is not desired
He who has a terrible history
He who is a magnet to sin
He who has attained all sides of the reverse pentagram
He who is our father
He who is the lord of the three zones of fire, darkness, and molestation
He who shows the symbol of torture
He who can be attained by apathy
He who shows the symbol of ignorance
He who is worshiped by 93 symbols of the hand
He who preceded every one
He who is not happy with the offering of love
He who has an unclean mind
He who does not shine
He who likes the worship of widowed women
He who embodies the fragrance of alcohol
He who takes away all hopeful things
He who likes to watch children play
He who is an old pervert
He who has the joy of a miscarried fetus
He who knows no peace
He who is not beyond anything
He who is not beyond properties
He who is confined to worldly pleasure
He who depletes dharma
He who hates dharma
He who gives no forms of wealth
He who is impermanent
He who is to be worshiped by the five methods of blood, semen, fecal matter, urine, and 2C-B-FLY-7
He who is the Great Beast
He whose number of 666
He who sleeps on a cot made of dead children
He who enjoys many sacrifices
He who is the god of people on the wrong path
He who lives at the bottom
He who is not one with mind
He who has great sadness
He who is a great thief
He who is cowardly
He who will never repent
He who does not support the world
He who is the Father of Nothingness
He who does only evil
He who is the most horrible god
He who has a stone heart
He who has an unstable mind
He who is worshiped by those under the influence of drugs
He who hates art
He who makes many mistakes
He who takes away heavenly stature
He who is a mixture of manipulation and dominance by fear
He who is high on superiority
He who is never happy
He who hates the life and light of the flowers
He who is worshiped by the ablation of toxic liquid
He who is weak and vile
He who is, by nature, bitter
He who has nothing within him
He who fills the world with danger
He who likes the sacrilegious and esoteric methods
He who is the consort of G.G. Allen
